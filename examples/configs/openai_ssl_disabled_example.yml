# Example configuration for using OpenAI-compatible endpoints with self-signed certificates
# This configuration demonstrates how to disable SSL verification when connecting to
# OpenAI-compatible endpoints that use self-signed certificates.
#
# WARNING: Disabling SSL verification should only be used in trusted environments
# or when you trust the endpoint and understand the security implications.
