# Building an Agentic System using NeMo Agent Toolkit

Through this series of notebooks, we demonstrate how you can use the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit to build, connect, evaluate, profile, and deploy an agentic system.

We showcase the building blocks that make up the agentic system, including tools, agents, workflows, and observability.

1. [Getting Started](1_getting_started_with_nat.ipynb)
2. [Bringing Your Own Agent](2_bringing_your_own_agent.ipynb)
3. [Adding Tools and Agents](3_adding_tools_and_agents.ipynb)
4. [Observability, Evaluation, and Profiling](4_observability_evaluation_and_profiling.ipynb)

We recommend opening these notebooks in a Jupyter Lab environment or Google Colab environment.

We also have a set of notebooks that are designed to be run in a Brev environment. See the [Brev Launchables](./launchables/README.md) for more details.

## Google Colab

To open these notebooks in a Google Colab environment, you can click the following link: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/)

## Jupyter Lab
If you want to run these notebooks locally, you can clone the repository and open the notebooks in a Jupyter Lab environment. To install the necessary dependencies, you can run the following command:

```bash
uv venv --seed .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install jupyterlab
```

Assuming you have cloned the repository and are in the root directory, you can open the notebooks in a Jupyter Lab environment by running the following command:

```bash
jupyter lab examples/notebooks
```
