# Launchables for NeMo-Agent-Toolkit

Launchables are an easy way to bundle a hardware and software environment into an easily shareable link, allowing for simple demos of GPU-powered software. 

NeMo-Agent-Toolkit offers the following notebooks in Launchable format: 

1. [GPU Cluster Sizing with NeMo-Agent-Toolkit](https://github.com/nv-edwli/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/develop/examples/notebooks/launchables/GPU_Cluster_Sizing_with_NeMo_Agent_Toolkit.ipynb)

    * This notebook demonstrates how to use the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit's sizing calculator to estimate the GPU cluster size required to accommodate a target number of users with a target response time. The estimation is based on the performance of the workflow at different concurrency levels.
    * The sizing calculator uses the [evaluation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/workflows/evaluate.html) and [profiling](https://docs.nvidia.com/nemo/agent-toolkit/latest/workflows/profiler.html) systems in the NeMo Agent toolkit.
