# Personal Finance

<!-- Note: "Agno" is the official product name despite Vale spelling checker warnings -->
Built on [Agno](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) and AgentIQ, this workflow is a personal financial planner that generates personalized financial plans using NVIDIA NIM (can be customized to use OpenAI models). It automates the process of researching, planning, and creating tailored budgets, investment strategies, and savings goals, empowering you to take control of your financial future with ease.

This personal financial planner was revised based on the [Awesome-LLM-App](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps) GitHub repo's [AI Personal Finance Planner](https://github.com/Shubhamsaboo/awesome-llm-apps/tree/main/ai_agent_tutorials/ai_personal_finance_agent) sample.

## Key Features

### AgentIQ

- **Pre-built Tools:** Leverages core AgentIQ library agent and tools.
- **ReAct Agent:** Performs reasoning between tool call; utilizes tool names and descriptions to appropriately route to the correct tool
- **Custom Plugin System:** Developers can bring in new tools using plugins.
- **High-level API:** Enables defining functions that transform into asynchronous LangChain tools.
- **Agentic Workflows:** Fully configurable via YAML for flexibility and productivity.
- **Ease of Use:** Simplifies developer experience and deployment.

### Agno

Agno is a lightweight library for building multimodal agents. Some of the key features of Agno include lightning fast, model agnostic, multimodal, multi agent, etc.  See Agno README [here](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno/blob/main/README.md) for more information about the library.


## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/intro/install.md) to create the development environment and install AgentIQ.

### Install this Workflow:

From the root directory of the AgentIQ library, run the following commands:

```bash
uv pip install -e examples/agno_personal_finance
```

### Set Up API Keys
If you have not already done so, follow the [Obtaining API Keys](../../docs/source/intro/get-started.md#obtaining-api-keys) instructions to obtain an NVIDIA API key. You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable to access NVIDIA AI services:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
export SERP_API_KEY=<SERP_API_KEY>
```

## Example Usage

### Run the Workflow

Run the following command from the root of the AgentIQ repo to execute this workflow with the specified input:

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/agno_personal_finance/src/aiq_agno_personal_finance/configs/config.yml --input "My financial goal is to retire at age 60.  I am currently 40 years old, working as a Machine Learning engineer at NVIDIA."
```

**Expected Output**
```console
$ aiq run --config_file examples/agno_personal_finance/src/aiq_agno_personal_finance/configs/config.yml --input "My financial goal is to retire at age 60.  I am currently 40 years old, working as a Machine Learning engineer at NVIDIA."

Aim to keep discretionary spending in check and allocate any excess funds towards savings and investments.\n5. **Tax Optimization**: Consider contributing to tax-advantaged accounts such as a Roth IRA or a tax-loss harvesting strategy to minimize tax liabilities.\n6. **Insurance and Risk Management**: Review and adjust insurance coverage, including life, disability, and health insurance, to ensure adequate protection against unexpected events.\n7. **Estate Planning**: Establish a will, consider setting up a trust, and designate beneficiaries for retirement accounts and life insurance policies.\n8. **Regular Review and Rebalancing**: Schedule annual reviews to assess progress, rebalance the portfolio, and make adjustments as needed to stay on track with retirement goals.\n\nBy following this plan, the Machine Learning engineer at NVIDIA can work towards achieving their goal of retiring at 60, while also ensuring a comfortable lifestyle and financial security.\n\nNext, let\'s search for investments that can help with long-term wealth creation.\n\n<function(search_google){"query": "investments for long-term wealth creation for NVIDIA employees", "num_results": 10}</function>', content_type='str', thinking=None, event='RunResponse', messages=[Message(role='system', content="You are a senior financial planner.

## Deployment-Oriented Setup

For a production deployment, use Docker:

### Build the Docker Image

Prior to building the Docker image ensure that you have followed the steps in the [Installation and Setup](#installation-and-setup) section, and you are currently in the AgentIQ virtual environment.

From the root directory of the `agentiq` repository, build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build --build-arg AIQ_VERSION=$(python -m setuptools_scm) -t agno_personal_finance -f examples/agno_personal_finance/Dockerfile .
```

### Run the Docker Container
Deploy the container:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 -e NVIDIA_API_KEY -e SERP_API_KEY agno_personal_finance
```

### Test the API
Use the following curl command to test the deployed API:

```bash
curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8000/generate' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"inputs": "My financial goal is to retire at age 60.  I am currently 40 years old, working as a Machine Learning engineer at NVIDIA."}'
  ```
