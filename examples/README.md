# Agent Intelligence Toolkit Examples

Each NVIDIA Agent Intelligence (AIQ) toolkit example demonstrates a particular feature or use case of the AIQ toolkit library. Most of these contain a custom [workflow](../docs/source/tutorials/index.md) along with a set of custom tools ([functions](../docs/source/workflows/functions/index.md) in AIQ toolkit). These examples can be used as a starting off point for creating your own custom workflows and tools. Each example contains a `README.md` file that explains the use case along with instructions on how to run the example.
