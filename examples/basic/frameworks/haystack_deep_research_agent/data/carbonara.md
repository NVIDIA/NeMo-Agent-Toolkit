# Roman Carbonara (Original Recipe)

This is a faithful Roman-style carbonara: no cream, no onion, no garlic. Just eggs, Pecorino Romano, guanciale, and black pepper.

## Ingredients (serves 2–3)
- 200 g spaghetti (or rigatoni)
- 100 g guanciale, cut into lardons (about 0.5–1 cm thick)
- 2 large egg yolks + 1 whole large egg (room temperature)
- 60 g Pecorino Romano, very finely grated (plus extra to serve)
- 1 to 1.5 tsp freshly ground black pepper (to taste)
- Kosher salt (for pasta water only)

Notes:
- Guanciale is traditional. Pancetta is a second-best substitute; bacon is a distant third.
- Pecorino Romano is traditional. If too sharp, you may use a 50/50 mix with Parmigiano Reggiano, but pure Pecorino is canonical.

## Equipment
- Large pot for boiling pasta
- Large sauté pan (cold start) for guanciale
- Mixing bowl (heatproof)
- Tongs or spider
- Fine grater and pepper mill

## Method
1) Prep the egg-and-cheese emulsion
- In a bowl, whisk together egg yolks, whole egg, grated Pecorino, and black pepper until thick like a loose paste. Set aside.

2) Render the guanciale
- Place guanciale in a cold pan. Turn heat to medium-low and render slowly until fat has melted and the meat is lightly crisp at the edges (about 6–10 minutes). Do not brown deeply. Turn off heat.
- Reserve the pan with all rendered fat. If there is too much fat, spoon off a little, but keep enough to coat the pasta generously.

3) Cook the pasta
- Boil pasta in well-salted water until just shy of al dente. Reserve about 250 ml (1 cup) of starchy pasta water.

4) Marry pasta, guanciale, and fat
- Transfer pasta directly into the pan with guanciale and fat over low heat. Toss to coat. Add a splash of hot pasta water to loosen and create a glossy base.

5) Create the sauce off-heat
- Remove the pan from heat. Wait 15–30 seconds so it is hot but not scorching.
- Add the egg-cheese mixture to the pasta, tossing vigorously and adding small splashes of hot pasta water as needed to form a silky, glossy sauce that clings to the noodles. The residual heat cooks the eggs gently—avoid scrambling.

6) Adjust and serve
- Taste and adjust with more Pecorino and black pepper if desired. Plate immediately.
- Top with a final dusting of Pecorino and a twist of pepper.

## Keys to success
- Temperature control: combine eggs off-heat and use pasta water to reach a creamy emulsion.
- Very fine cheese grating: ensures quick melting and smooth texture.
- Freshly cracked pepper: be generous.
- Work fast: carbonara should be glossy and served immediately.

## Canonical checklist (what not to add)
- No cream
- No garlic or onion
- No butter or oil (beyond guanciale fat)
- No wine

Buon appetito!
