AIQ Toolkit: A Comprehensive AI Workflow Framework

The AIQ Toolkit is a powerful framework for building AI-powered workflows and applications. It provides a unified interface for working with multiple AI frameworks including LangChain, LlamaIndex, Haystack, and Semantic Kernel.

Key Features:

1. Multi-Framework Support: AIQ Toolkit seamlessly integrates different AI frameworks, allowing developers to choose the best tool for each task without being locked into a single ecosystem.

2. Builder Pattern: The framework uses a builder pattern that makes it easy to construct complex AI workflows through configuration rather than extensive coding.

3. Function Registration: Functions can be easily registered and reused across different workflows, promoting modularity and code reuse.

4. Tool Integration: The toolkit provides easy integration with various tools including web search, document retrieval, and language models.

5. Agent Support: AIQ supports different types of agents including ReAct agents, reasoning agents, and custom workflow agents.

6. Configuration-Driven: Most workflows can be configured through YAML files, making them easy to modify and deploy.

Architecture:

The AIQ Toolkit follows a modular architecture where:
- Functions represent individual AI capabilities
- Workflows orchestrate multiple functions
- Tools provide external integrations
- Agents handle complex reasoning and tool usage

This architecture allows for flexible composition of AI capabilities while maintaining clean separation of concerns.

Use Cases:

AIQ Toolkit is particularly well-suited for:
- Research applications that need to combine web search with document analysis
- Multi-step reasoning tasks that require different AI capabilities
- Enterprise applications that need to integrate multiple AI services
- Rapid prototyping of AI workflows

Getting Started:

To get started with AIQ Toolkit, install the package and its dependencies, configure your AI services, and define your workflow through the configuration system. The framework handles the complex orchestration automatically.
