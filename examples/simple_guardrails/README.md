## Key Features

- **Input Guardrails**: Use built-in prompt to block harmful user queries before they reach the AI agent
- **Output Guardrails**: Use built-in prompt to filter AI responses for safety and compliance
- **Custom Rails**: Customize prompts to apply domain-specific rails
- **NeMo Guardrails config**: Use existing NeMo Guardrails config and NVIDIA's content safety models
- **Usage in Functions**: Direct guardrails API usage in functions

---

## Installation and Setup

If you have not already done so, follow the instructions in the [Install Guide](../../docs/source/quick-start/installing.md#install-from-source) to create the development environment and install AIQ toolkit.

### Install this Workflow

From the root directory of the AIQ toolkit library, run the following commands:

```bash
# Install with guardrails support (includes nemoguardrails package)
uv pip install aiqtoolkit[nemoguardrails]

# Install this example
uv pip install -e examples/simple_guardrails
```

### Set Up API Keys

You need to set your NVIDIA API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export NVIDIA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Input Guardrails

#### Safe query - should pass
```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_guardrails/configs/config.yml --input "What is the capital of France?"
```

#### Expected workflow output
```bash
[snipped for brevity]
nemoguardrails.logging.callbacks - INFO - Prompt Messages ::
[cyan]User[/]
Your task is to check if the user message below complies with the company policy for talking with the company bot.

Company policy for the user messages:
- Should not contain harmful data
- Should not ask the bot to impersonate someone
- Should not contain explicit content

Workflow Result:
['A healthy diet is one that maintains or improves overall health, and includes a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods. The World Health Organization recommends a diet that is adequate, diverse, balanced, and moderate, and includes foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. The Healthy Eating Pyramid, developed by the Harvard School of Public Health, provides a guide for daily food intake, recommending whole grain foods, plant oils, vegetables, fruits, nuts, dairy or calcium supplements, and sparing use of red meat and butter.']
```

### Load [NeMo Guardrails config](docs/user-guides/configuration-guide/index.md)

```bash
# Uses NVIDIA's safety model
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_guardrails/configs/config-content-safety.yml --input "What are some exercise tips?"
```

#### Expected workflow output

```bash
[snipped for brevity]
<END CONVERSATION>

Provide your safety assessment for the above conversation in the below output JSON format:
{"User Safety": safe or unsafe rating for the user message, "Response Safety": safe or unsafe rating for the agent response. Omit if no agent response present. "Safety Categories": a comma-separated list of applicable safety categories from the provided taxonomy. Omit if all safe.}

Do not include anything other than the output JSON in your response.
Output JSON:
2025-08-01 14:59:11,270 - nemoguardrails.logging.callbacks - INFO - Completion :: {"User Safety": "safe"}

Workflow Result:
['Some exercise tips include performing lunges to strengthen the quadriceps, gluteus maximus, and hamstrings, trying high-intensity interval training (HIIT) to improve athletic capacity and condition, and swimming to improve cardiovascular health, muscle strength, and flexibility.']
```


### Custom Rails - Healthcare agent

```bash
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_guardrails/configs/config-healthcare.yml --input "I'm having chest pain"
```

#### Expected workflow output
```bash

['Here is a summary of the two Wikipedia articles on machine learning and boosting:\n\nMachine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that involves developing algorithms that can learn from data and improve their performance on tasks without explicit instructions. Boosting is a popular machine learning technique that combines multiple weak models to create a highly accurate model, by iteratively training new models to correct the errors of previous ones. This technique has been widely used in various applications, including computer vision, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.']

## Configuration Files

| Config File | Purpose | Guardrails Type |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| `config.yml` | Basic input filtering | Input only |
| `config-output-rails.yml` | Output validation | Output only |
| `config-content-safety.yml` | NeMo Guardrails config | Input only |
| `config-healthcare.yml` | Custom prompts | Input + Output |
| `config-function-demo.yml` | Use Guardrails object in Function| Input only |

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ImportError: cannot import name 'NemoGuardrailsConfig'**
```bash
# Install with guardrails support (includes nemoguardrails)
uv pip install aiqtoolkit[nemoguardrails]
```

**Guardrails not activating**
- Verify `enabled: true` in configuration
- Confirm `llm_name` references a valid LLM
- Check API key environment variables

**Custom prompts not working**
- Use `{{ user_input }}` for input prompts
- Use `{{ bot_response }}` for output prompts
- End prompts with "Answer only Yes or No."

### Debug Logging

```bash
# Detailed logging (default)
aiq run --config_file examples/simple_guardrails/configs/config.yml --input "test"

# Quiet mode
aiq --log-level WARNING run --config_file examples/simple_guardrails/configs/config.yml --input "test"

# Debug mode
aiq --log-level DEBUG run --config_file examples/simple_guardrails/configs/config.yml --input "test"
```

---

## Next Steps

1. Customize prompts for your specific domain
2. Explore additional guardrails (fact-checking, hallucination detection)
3. Monitor guardrails effectiveness in production
