This made it difficult to address certain issues promptly.\r\n**Overall Satisfaction with Deployment:** Overall satisfaction with the deployment and implementation: 3.8/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐. While the system performed well in many aspects, there were areas where the process could have been more efficient and user-friendly.\r\nQuantitative feedback rating - on a scale of 1-5)\r\nThe DataMaster Pro_storage has met some of my expectations but has also shown several critical shortcomings that have impacted my overall satisfaction. While it performs well under moderate loads and has a user-friendly interface, the heat management issues and file corruption problems have been persistent and concerning. The system reached temperatures as high as 55°C during sustained use, which is outside the recommended operating range of 20°C to 40°C. This has raised concerns about long-term reliability and potential hardware damage. Additionally, occasional file corruption has occurred, requiring manual recovery efforts and increasing the risk of data loss. Despite these issues, the initial setup was relatively straightforward, and the support team is knowledgeable, though response times are often slow. Overall, I would rate the DataMaster Pro_storage a 3/5, as it has some redeeming qualities but also several critical issues that need to be addressed.\r\nQuantitative",
