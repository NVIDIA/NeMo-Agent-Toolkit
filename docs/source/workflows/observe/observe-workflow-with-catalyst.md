# Observing a Workflow with Catalyst

This guide provides a step-by-step process to enable observability in an AIQ toolkit workflow using Catalyst for tracing. By the end of this guide, you will have:
- Configured telemetry in your workflow.
- Able to view traces in the Catalyst platform.

### Step 1: Sign up for Catalyst
- Visit `https://catalyst.raga.ai/signup` to create your account.

### Step 2: Create a Project
After logging in, create a new project.
- Project Name: Choose any name.
- Use Case: `Agentic Application`

### Step3: Generate API Credentials
Go to your [profile](https://catalyst.raga.ai/settings/authenticate) settings to generate your:
- access key
- secret key

### Step4: Configure Your Environment
Set the following environment variables in your terminal
```yaml
export CATALYST_ACCESS_KEY=YOUR_ACCESS_KEY
export CATALYST_SECRET_KEY=YOUR_SECRET_KEY
export base_url=https://catalyst.raga.ai/api
```

### Step 5: Modify Workflow Configuration

Update your workflow configuration file to include the telemetry settings.

Example configuration:
```bash
general:
  telemetry:
    tracing:
      catalyst:
        _type: catalyst
        project: "catalyst-demo"
        dataset: "catalyst-dataset"
```

### Step 6: Run Your Workflow
From the root directory of the AIQ toolkit library, install dependencies and execute your workflow.

**Example:**
```bash
uv pip install -e examples/simple_calculator
```
As the workflow runs, telemetry data will start showing up in Catalyst.

### Step 7: View Traces Data in Catalyst
- Open your browser and navigate to `https://catalyst.raga.ai/projects`.
- Locate your workflow traces under the **your-dataset** section in projects.
- Inspect function execution details, latency, total tokens, request timelines and other info under Info and Attributes tab of an individual trace.

### Debugging
If you encounter issues while downloading the Catalyst package, try uninstalling and installing:
```bash
uv pip uninstall ragaai-catalyst

uv pip install ragaai-catalyst
```
