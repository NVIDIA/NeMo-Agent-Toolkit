# Observing a Workflow with Dynatrace

This guide shows how to stream OpenTelemetry (OTel) traces from your NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit workflows to the [OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) ingest API](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/discover-dynatrace/references/dynatrace-api/environment-api/opentelemetry), which in turn provides the ability to have full visibility into the performance of AI/LLM models and agent interactions​. 

In this guide, you will learn how to:
* Deploy a [Dynatrace OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/ingest-from/opentelemetry/collector) with a configuration that exports traces into Dynatrace
* Configure your workflow (YAML) or Python script to send traces to the OTel collector.
* Run the workflow and view traces within Dynatrace

## Step 1: Dynatrace Account

You will need access to your Dynatrace environment.  If you don’t have one you can simply [signup to get started](https://www.dynatrace.com/signup/)

## Step 2: Dynatrace API Token

Dynatrace APIs use token based authentication. To generate an access token:
1. Go to Access tokens.
1. Select Generate new token.
1. Enter a name for your token.
1. Select these [required scopes for the OTLP API](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/otel-getstarted-otlpexport#authentication-export-to-activegate):
    * `openTelemetryTrace.ingest`
    * `metrics.ingest`
    * `Logs.ingest`
1. Select Generate token.
1. Copy the generated token to the clipboard. Store the token in a password manager for future use and for the configuration below.

## Step 3: Configure OTel Collector

Configure an OTel Collector configuration file using an `otlphttp` exporter to the Dynatrace OTLP API as shown in the example below. Refer to the [Dynatrace documentation](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/otel-collector-config) as required.

```yaml
receivers:
  otlp:
    protocols:
      grpc:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4317
      http:
        endpoint: 0.0.0.0:4318
processors:
  cumulativetodelta:
exporters:
  otlphttp:
    endpoint: "https://<YOUR-DYNATRACE-ENVIRONMENT>.live.dynatrace.com/api/v2/otlp"
    headers:
      Authorization: "Api-Token <YOUR-DYNATRACE-TOKEN>"
service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: []
      exporters: [otlphttp]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [cumulativetodelta]
      exporters: [otlphttp]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: []
      exporters: [otlphttp]
```

## Step 4: Install and run your configured OTel Collector

There are many ways to deploy an [OTel Collector](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/ingest-from/opentelemetry/collector/deployment) but for this example, an OTel Collector is created using Docker with the configuration from the previous step into a file named `otelcollectorconfig.yaml` with the [Dynatrace distribution of the OpenTelemetry Collector](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/ingest-from/opentelemetry/collector).  

```bash
docker run -d -v $(pwd)/otelcollectorconfig.yaml:/etc/otelcol/config.yaml \ 
-p 4318:4318 \ 
dynatrace/dynatrace-otel-collector:latest
```

Once running, the collector endpoint is: `http://localhost:4318`. 

## Step 5: Install the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit OpenTelemetry Subpackages

```bash
# Install all optional telemetry extras
uv pip install -e '.[telemetry]'

# Install specific telemetry extras required for Dynatrace
uv pip install -e '.[opentelemetry]'
```

## Step 6: Modify NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit Workflow Configuration

Update your workflow configuration file to include the telemetry settings.

Example configuration:
```yaml
general:
  telemetry:
    tracing:
      otelcollector:
        _type: otelcollector
        # The endpoint where you have deployed the otel collector
        endpoint: http://localhost:4318/v1/traces
        project: your_project_name
```

## Step 7: Run the workflow

From the root directory of the NVIDIA NeMo Agent toolkit library, install dependencies and run the pre-configured `simple_web_query` example.

**Example:**
```bash
# Install the workflow and plugins
uv pip install -e examples/getting_started/simple_web_query

# Run the workflow with OTel/Dynatrace telemetry settings
nat run --config_file examples/getting_started/simple_web_query/configs/config.yml --input "What is LangSmith?" 
```

As the workflow runs, telemetry data will start showing up in Dynatrace.

## Step 8: View spans

View the exported traces within the [Dynatrace Distributed Tracing App](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/analyze-explore-automate/distributed-tracing/distributed-tracing-app) as shown below.
