# ðŸ§ª Temporary MCP Auth Planning Notes (Experimental)
This is currently a scratch pad for planning MCP auth. It will be rewritten when all the components are ready.

## Phases of MCP auth implementation
1. [Completed] MCP client with new `mcp_oauth2` auth provider.
2. [Pending] MCP protected server with `TokenVerifier`.
3. [Pending] Changes for end-to-end MCP auth testing.

## Steps for testing MCP auth
1. Start the MCP server with auth enabled
```bash
nat mcp serve --config_file examples/MCP/simple_calculator_mcp/configs/config-mcp-server-auth.yml
```
This starts a protected MCP server on port 9901. This MCP server has a stub token verifier that will always return success without AS introspection.

2. Start a container with the example auth server from the MCP repo. This will start the auth server on port 9000.
```bash
docker build -t mcp-sample-as -f examples/MCP/simple_calculator_mcp/deploy_example_as/Dockerfile examples/MCP/simple_calculator_mcp/deploy_example_as/
docker run -p 9000:9000 mcp-sample-as
```
This starts the auth server on port 9000.

3. Start NAT UI and enable websocket

4. Run the workflow with MCP auth enabled client

```bash
nat serve --config_file examples/MCP/simple_calculator_mcp/configs/config-mcp-auth-dynamic.yml
```
This starts the workflow with a MCP client that uses the `mcp_oauth2` auth provider. This provider:
- Discovers the auth server endpoints.
- Registers a client with the auth server.
- Performs the OAuth2 authorization code flow using the `OAuth2AuthCodeFlowProvider`.
