## [1.3.0] - 2025-10-24

### 🚀 Notable Features and Improvements
* [ADK Support](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.3/docs/source/reference/frameworks-overview.md): Supports Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). Adds tool calling, core observability, and LLM integration in this release.
* [Control-Flow Agents](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.3/docs/source/workflows/about/index.md): [Sequential Executor](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.3/docs/source/workflows/about/sequential-executor.md) (Linear Agent) and [Router Agent](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.3/docs/source/workflows/about/router-agent.md) now control flow patterns of tool calls and sub-agents.
* [Function Groups](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.3/docs/source/workflows/function-groups.md): Packages multiple related functions together so they share configuration, context, and resources.
* [Hyperparameter Agent Optimizer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.3/docs/source/reference/optimizer.md): Automates hyperparameter tuning and prompt engineering for workflows.
* [Introductory Notebook Improvements](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.3/examples/notebooks/README.md): Reorganizes getting started notebooks and adds Open in Colab links.
* [LLM Improvements](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.3/docs/source/workflows/llms/index.md)
  - Adds LiteLLM Provider
  - Supports GPT-5 (`/chat/completions` endpoint only)
  - Adds Nemotron thinking configuration
* [MCP Improvements](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.3/docs/source/workflows/mcp/index.md)
  - Supports `streamable-http` - `sse` is no longer the default transport type.
  - Supports initial authorization - Enables connecting to MCP servers that require authentication.
  - Supports multiple MCP tools from a single configuration - Pulls in entire tool sets published by MCP servers or filters them based on user configuration.
  - Enhances CLI utilities for MCP servers and clients - Improves the `nat mcp` sub command for querying, calling, and listing tools.
* Python 3.13 support

## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-20
### 📦 Overview
This is a documentation only release, there are no code changes in this release.

### 📜 Full Change Log
* Add a version switcher to the documentation builds https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/pull/681

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-20
### 📦 Overview
The NeMo Agent toolkit, formerly known as Agent Intelligence (AIQ) toolkit, has been renamed to align with the NVIDIA NeMo family of products. This release brings significant new capabilities and improvements across authentication, resource management, observability, and developer experience. The toolkit continues to offer backwards compatibility, making the transition seamless for existing users.

While NeMo Agent Toolkit is designed to be compatible with the previous version, users are encouraged to update their code to follow the latest conventions and best practices. Migration instructions are provided in the [migration guide](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.2/docs/source/resources/migration-guide.md).

* [Test Time Compute](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.2/docs/source/reference/test-time-compute.md): Dynamically reallocate compute resources after model training, allowing agents to optimize reasoning, factual accuracy, and system robustness without retraining the base model.
* [Sizing Calculator](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.2/docs/source/workflows/sizing-calc.md): Estimate GPU cluster requirements to support your target number of users and desired response times, simplifying deployment planning and scaling.
* [Object Store Integration](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.2/docs/source/extend/object-store.md): Connect and manage data through supported object stores, improving agent extensibility and enabling advanced data workflows.
* [Enhanced Cursor Rules](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.2/docs/source/tutorials/build-a-demo-agent-workflow-using-cursor-rules.md): Build new workflows or extend existing ones by leveraging cursor rules, making agent development faster and more flexible.
* [Interactive Notebooks](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/tree/release/1.2/examples/notebooks): Access a suite of onboarding and example notebooks to accelerate agent workflow development, testing, and experimentation.
* [Observability Refactor](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Agent-Toolkit/blob/release/1.2/docs/source/workflows/observe/index.md): Onboard new observability and monitoring platforms more easily, and take advantage of improved plug-in architecture for workflow inspection and analysis.
